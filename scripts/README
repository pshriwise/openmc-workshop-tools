These scripts are used to manage a set of AWS instances for the workshop. The
workflow is:

 1: (no scripts for this) start the proxy server(s) and the server for the URL
    app.

 2: Pick a name for a group of instances. The name itself does not matter; it's
    just a bookkeping device. Ex: "hydrogen"

 3: Run launch_instances.py to start the servers that host the notebooks.

 4: Wait a minute or two for the servers to finish initializing.

 5: Run add_hostnames.py to assign a unique hostname to each new instance.

 6: Run start_nb_servers.py to checkout the latest repo branch and start the
    Jupyter Lab servers.

 7: Run update_proxy.py so that the proxy server(s) will send web traffic to the
    appropriate machines.

 8: After the workshop is complete, run stop_intances.py and then (optionally) terminate_instances.py.
